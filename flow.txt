Land on GuestIdpAuthenticationRequestFilter for request "${prefix}/SSO"
   - check if there is a SAMLRequest already saved in the database
   - redirect to login/${id}
   - client side ask email with NEXT - if known user, send magic link

   - otherwise ask givenName and familyName. Back and Next buttons
   - provision user and send magic link

   - password less checkbox which is checked by default

   if so check email POST attribute, find user, throw error if not present otherwise send magic-link-email
  - otherwise save the raw SAMLRequest authn request in the session / database: see IdpAuthenticationRequestFilter#getAuthenticationRequest together with relayState
  - redirect to /login which is picked up by the preact app.

Client side:

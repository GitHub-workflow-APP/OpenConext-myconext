Land on GuestIdpAuthenticationRequestFilter for request "${prefix}/SSO"
  - check if there is a SAMLRequest already saved in the session - if so check email POST attribute, find user, throw error if not present otherwise send magic-link-email
  - otherwise save the raw SAMLRequest authn request in the session / database: see IdpAuthenticationRequestFilter#getAuthenticationRequest together with relayState
  - redirect to /login which is picked up by the preact app.

Client side:

User adds email and POST to /saml/SSO - picked up again by GuestIdpAuthenticationRequestFilter
